Functions along with it's lexical scope form closures.
Having said that I mean is, a closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to it's surrounding state. (the lexical environment)

Basically, a closure gives you the access to outer functions scope from an inner function

Example ::

  function d()
 { var g=7;
   function a() {
     var x = 10;

     function b() {
       console.log(x,g);
     }
     x = 100;
     b();

   }
   a();
 }
  d();

Output ::
100 7
